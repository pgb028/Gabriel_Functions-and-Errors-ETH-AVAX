# Gabriel_Functions-and-Errors-ETH-AVAX

This Solidity program focuses on error handling and the various functions utilized for it.

We will tackle 3 functions given on the project

# Description

This program consists of 3 functions
 
**Require()** - 
**Assert()** - 
**Revert()** - 
# Getting Started

**Executing the program**

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., FuncErrorProject.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:


To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile final-project.sol" button.

After compilation, the contract can be deployed by clicking the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ErrorHandler" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, click on the "ErrorHandler" contract first on the left-hand sidebar. You can interact with the program by setting a value as the owner, by passing two numerical arguments to the assertExample() function to see how it works, and by passing a value to the revertExample() function as well.
